    <h2>About Us<h2>

        <h5>WHO ARE WE?</h5>
        <p> Yoka√≠-Gaming is a community built by gamers, for gamers.
            Ryan, who owns and runs the community decided to move from just gaming, over to something new.
            We did a lot of research on what companies & brands bring to the content creation community, what we found was that most of the time its very niche and expensive.
            We decided that this isn't right, why provide expensive solutions, when you can provide cost-effective solutions with content creators directly at the heart of this evolution? </p>

        <h5>WHAT DO WE DO?</h5>
        <p> We bring cost-effective, individual and brand merchandise to the crowd.
            We bring social media management, as well as full participation in Giveaway each week, which we award to our best improved and most participating streamer each week!
