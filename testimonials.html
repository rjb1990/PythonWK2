<h3> Nxtrogen - Luke</h3>
<p class="short"> 
    Yokai provides me with a platform that allows me to show my potential to more people and let's me connect with them on a more personal level.
   
   The people are great and have always been there to give a helping hand. I'm happy to be a part of it and can't wait to see what the future holds. </p>

    What's up gamers, it's ya boi Impulse/Jake
I'm a twitch affiliate that mainly streams Rocket League, I played the prequel SSARPBC since I was 10!

Other than Rocket League I play a variety of games such as: League of Legends, Osu!, Overwatch, Call of Duty, CSGO, Fortnite, Apex Legends and many more!

My aim's for streaming is to build a community of cuties I can hang out and game with!

Being in Yokai I believe provides me with a lot of opportunities that I wouldn't have if I were streaming solo such as giveaways and hype nights! The team really helps me pull in more supportive viewers and the community in a whole is really friendly and chill!
